# Beirut: Austin Food Truck
Beirut is a food truck located at the Domain in Austin, Texas serving authentic Lebanese food. This is their landing page for users to discover, request catering appointments and get directions to the restaurant.

## Task 
Create a single page web application that is intuitive to navigate and find neccesary information while also retaining a unique feel to convey the personality of the brand. We started by taking the companies logo and tweaking it to look natural on the page. We made the nav bar sticky so that the user is always alble to jump to the info they require.

We used animate.css to create animations for content and created animations that appear based on scroll position. We the user clicks 'Get Directions' the default Map application for their device will then open. On an iPhone or iOS device, it will open Apple Maps. Android opens Google Maps as does a web browser. This was done to avoid the annoying experience of getting directed to the web version of Google Maps on iPhone which can be hard to use and may cause a person to leave the site. 

## Future Development
* Add food carousel in place of the masthead to show more food options.
* Create an online ordering system for t-shirts and other shipable items
